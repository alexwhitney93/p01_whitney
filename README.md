I started out following Professor Madden's tutorial to make sure I could get that to build.
After that I wanted to use the timer and have lyrics display in the label once the button was hit.
I tried using NSTimer and individual methods for each line of the song, but I couldn't get it to work
using the same type of NSTimer call that Professor Madden used in class. I messed around for a while
looking stuff up on stackoverflow.

After a while I accepted failure and just made 5 labels with 5 different methods to fill them each
individually once the button was hit. I ended up changing the text color, but other than that my 
project was very trivial.
